"The dataset is taken from Kaggle."
*Step 1: Data Input & Processing
  <=Load the dataset using pandas (pd.read_csv('data.csv') for CSV files).
  <=Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize numerical data, etc.).
*Step 2: Model Development
  <=Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
  <=Choose an appropriate supervised learning model (classification or regression). 
  Examples:
      Classification: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVM.
      Regression: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Regressor.
   <=Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall (for classification) or RMSE, MAE (for regression).
   *Step 3: Results Presentation
   <=Display the modelâ€™s accuracy and key insights from the predictions.

    <=Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations, such as histograms, scatter plots, or confusion matrices.
*Step 4: User Interaction
<=Implement a command-line interface (CLI) or use Streamlit for a simple GUI.

<=Allow users to input parameters and analyze results dynamically.
Step 5: Documentation
Comment the code properly and provide docstrings for functions.
